Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,149 out of   9,312   12%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,240 out of   9,312   24%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,593 out of   4,656   34%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,593 out of   1,593 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,593   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,295 out of   9,312   24%
    Number used as logic:             1,846
    Number used as a route-thru:         55
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     138

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 12 out of     232    5%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       2
  Number of RAMB16s:                     16 out of      20   80%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                3 out of      20   15%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.72

Peak Memory Usage:  819 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  12 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   11 secs
